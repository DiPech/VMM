# Important info

**Voxel Model Maker (VMM)** - it's 3D-editor voxel model editor, rewritten to edit Cube World in-game models. Take a look at `features` and `media` sections. If you want to change it source codes - take a look at `license` and `source code disclaimer` sections.

## Features

- You can edit models direct from **in-game database**.
- You can edit models that **not stored directly in database**.
- VMM has many features, open in-app help to see all options:
    - **Two different control types:** rotate around model and WASD fly mode.
    - **Four editing types:** add/remove voxels, fill a group of voxels with the same colour, and other.
    - **Copy/Paste/Delete large voxel groups with extendable frame**.
    - Search models by name.
    - Manage model size.
    - **Convert .BMP image to `X`x`Y`x`1`-sized model that you can simply edit as you want (e.g. make it volumed, see my AK-47 Voxel Model below)**.
    - A lot of functions i had totally forgot about...

## Build

[!!! Actual VMM build can be downloaded from here !!!](https://www.cwmods.com/downloads/info172-VoxelModelMaker.ModelEditor..html)

# License

You can use it and change it for free. I don't care about it and placing it here, because today is 06.10.2019 and a few days ago Cube World 2.0 (that sucks i believe) has been released on Steam. Since, i have received a lot of questions and suggestions about VMM, but i don't want to do anything with it. Again, feel free to use it as you want.

# Media

# Source code disclaimer

If you want to edit the source code you should be warned that it can **traumatise** your mind. *I've warned you, my friend!*. It's because it's my first large written myself app. I had been writing it almost two years from scratch. Before this code i didn't write anything more complicated that console calculator. In fact, with this project i was learning programming and 3D graphic (in 2012-2013 years).
